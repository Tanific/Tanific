### Hi! :)

I'm Tonje / Tani, and I am a 23 year old front end-development student from Norway. I started learning to code in 2021, and I love it! It's interesting to create user friendly solutions and designs, and I love the freedom with endless possibilities when it comes to coding. 
I'm constantly improving and learning everyday, and I hope that in the future I'll work as a web developer <3
